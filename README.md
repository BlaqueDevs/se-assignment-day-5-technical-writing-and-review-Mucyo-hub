Plain language improves retention, making it easier to remember key points.
When Should You Use Jargon?
If writing for experts who understand the terminology.
When using jargon, always define it in simple terms for clarity.
Example
❌ Jargon-heavy:
"Leveraging an API facilitates seamless data integration between disparate systems."

✅ Plain language:
"Using an API helps different systems share data easily."


6 .Can you provide examples of how simplifying terms (e.g., "start" instead of "initiate") improves comprehension?

Yes! Simplifying terms makes communication clearer, more direct, and easier to understand for a broader audience. Here are a few examples:

"Initiate" vs. "Start"

Complex: Please initiate the backup process.
Simple: Please start the backup.
Why it’s better: "Start" is more common and immediately understood.
"Utilize" vs. "Use"

Complex: We should utilize available resources.
Simple: We should use available resources.
Why it’s better: "Use" is shorter and doesn’t sound overly formal.
"Terminate" vs. "End"

Complex: The contract will terminate next month.
Simple: The contract will end next month.
Why it’s better: "End" is more familiar and avoids unnecessary complexity.
"Facilitate" vs. "Help"

Complex: This tool will facilitate collaboration.
Simple: This tool will help collaboration.
Why it’s better: "Help" is a natural word that speeds up understanding.
"Commence" vs. "Begin" or "Start"

Complex: The meeting will commence at noon.
